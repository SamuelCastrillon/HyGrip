# HyGrip
HyGrip is a small mod for Hytale that adds a basic robotic arm to the game. It's designed to make moving objects easier, especially when working on large structures.  This is the first step in a larger project called HyFactory, but for now, it focuses on a single function: gripping, lifting, and placing.
